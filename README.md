The dataset sales_data.csv contains sales transaction records.Each row represents a single sale with information such as: Product,Region,Customer,Quantity Sold,Revenue
This dataset is directly used in the program for analysis and visualization.
Visualizations: 
Bar Chart – Revenue by Product
Displays total revenue generated by each product
Helps identify products with high and low sales performance

Pie Chart – Sales Distribution by Region
Shows percentage contribution of each region to total revenue
Highlights the region with the strongest sales presence
All charts generated by the program are saved in the visualizations/ folder.

This project demonstrates the practical use of Python for sales data analysis. By combining data exploration, metric calculation, and visualization, the program successfully transforms raw sales data into clear and actionable insights. The structured approach makes the project easy to understand and extend.
